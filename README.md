# UdacityLandingPageProject
Project 2 for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program


This project implements Javascript to create an interactive navigation bar that populates anchor links for each corresponding section of the page. I took the shell that Udacity provided and built upon the HTML and CSS.

For this project, I added functionality to the navigation bar through javascript by linking each section to the relative navigation menu anchor. I then created a "scroll to top" button by adding HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I also added a smooth scrolling function through CSS to keep the scroll from jumping.

In the console as well as in the viewport, I added indications for which section is currently active.

All of the CSS I added is below the Theme State Rules CSS. I added the HTML button at the top of the main heading since its location is determined by CSS and it would be easy to find if you wanted to remove it.
