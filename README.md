## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.



For this project, I added functionality to the navigation bar through javascript by linking each section to the relative navigation menu anchor. I then created a "scroll to top" button by adding HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I also added a smooth scrolling function through CSS to keep the scroll from jumping.

In the console as well as in the viewport, I added indications for which section is currently active.

All of the CSS I added is below the Theme State Rules CSS. I added the HTML button at the top of the main heading since its location is determined by CSS and it would be easy to find if you wanted to remove it.
